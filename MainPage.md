# Introduction #

The path to your iPhoto library is n longer hard-coded. You can now adapt your path in the config.xml.

# Details #

I develop this project in Eclipse and checked everything project-related in, also the .project and .cproject files.

To compile you need QT 4.x and of course a C++ compiler + standard libraries. Enjoy.

If you don't want to compile by yourself and are running Ubuntu Linux 10.04 32bit you can also download a compiled version of this application in the downloads section which works without installation (just unzip, adapt config.xml and run).

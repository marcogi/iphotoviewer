#summary Notes for testing the project in its current state.

= Introduction =

By now the path to your iPhoto libary is hard-coded in iphotoviewer.cpp. When trying the
current source, please adapt this path to your local path or create a symlink


= Details =

I develop this project in Eclipse and checked everything project-related in, also the .project and .cproject files.

To compile you need QT 4.x and of course a C++ compiler + standard libraries. Enjoy.

iPhotoViewer allows you, to view your iPhoto library on Linux (use case: You sync your iPhoto library via e.g. Dropbox or SkyDrive from your Mac to your Linux / Windows box. This app enables you to easily browse your photos and albums you maintain in iPhoto).

### Current State ###

iPhotoViewer allows to browse your photos by albums and events, in a thumbnailsview, similar to the one in iPhoto. You can also view a larger version of a photo by double-clicking its thumbnail.

We have a precompiled binary in our downloads section now. It runs under Ubuntu Linux 10.04 32bit and needs no installation (see the wiki for further information). If you want to run it under other systems you need to checkout the SVN and compile it by yourself.

iPhotoViewer currently only supports iPhoto '10 databases.
